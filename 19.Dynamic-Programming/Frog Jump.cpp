// There is a frog on the 1st step of an N stairs long staircase. The frog wants to reach the Nth stair. HEIGHT[i] is the height of the (i+1)th stair.If Frog jumps from ith to jth stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by |HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] |.In the Frog is on ith staircase, he can jump either to (i+1)th stair or to (i+2)th stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from 1st stair to Nth stair.

int f(int n, vector<int> &heights,vector<int> &dp){
    if(n == 0){
        return 0;
    }
    if(dp[n]!=-1){
        return dp[n];
    }
    int left = f(n-1,heights,dp) + abs(heights[n]-heights[n-1]);
    int right = 1e8;
    if(n>1)
        right = f(n-2,heights,dp) + abs(heights[n]-heights[n-2]);
    return dp[n] = min(left,right);
}
int frogJump(int n, vector<int> &heights)

    vector<int> dp(n+1,0);
    
    dp[0] = 0;
    for(int i = 1;i<n;i++){
           int left = dp[i-1] + abs(heights[i]-heights[i-1]);
           int right = 1e8;
           if(i>1)
                right = dp[i-2] + abs(heights[i]-heights[i-2]);
            dp[i] = min(left,right);
    }
    return dp[n-1];
//     return
